## Initial Setup

To dockerize the application install <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/" target="_blank">Docker</a> and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/" target="_blank">Docker Compose</a>

Once the services are setup go to the directory path and run these commands-

 ```
 $ docker-compose build 
 $ docker-compose up
 ```
 
 Once the setup is complete you will be able to access the application on <a href="https://localhost:3000" target="_blank">localhost:3000</a>
